in x && y: if x=0 then compiler short circuits the calculation, i.e., result is 0 regardless of y; if x=1 then y has to be evaluated!
in x || y: if x=1 then compiler short circuits the calculation, i.e., result is 1 regardless of y; if x=0 then y has to be evaluated!
in x==y bot x and y have to be evaluated and then compared to get the result.
